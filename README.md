## Code once, build twice: product flavours at rescue.
Have you ever wondered how to make a free and a paid version of your app with as little effort as possible? Or let’s say that you just need to release two different versions of the same app with a few changes in theme, graphics or functionalities. Did you used the “product flavours” feature of android to do that?

If the answer is NO, then see this example and read my blog post at http://antoniocappiello.com/2015/10/24/code-once-build-twice-product-flavours-at-rescue/
